# Ruby Schema

Ruby schema is a collection of schemas for the YAML and JSON configuration in common Ruby gems. This gives you auto-complete and validation for these YAML files in text editors that support the YAML language server.

![Example of auto-complete](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8038624-4df5-4dd7-9fcf-787d5c8a5f71)

Just add the `yaml-language-server` comment to the top of your YAML files.

## Contributing

If you find an issue with a schema, for example it says that something is invalid when it isnâ€™t, please open an issue with an example.

The schemas are written in JSON Schema version 7 (since thatâ€™s the version that YAML LSP supports). They are currently committed directly to the `dist` folder, which is deployed automatically to Cloudflare.

## Why is it called RubySchema?

I know itâ€™s confusing. RubySchema provides JSON Schemas for YAML files. ðŸ¤¯ The name reflects the purpose of providing schemas specifically for the Ruby community, where a lot of Ruby gems rely on YAML/JSON configuration files. Thereâ€™s another project called [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org) with a significantly wider scope.
